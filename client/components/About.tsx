                  This is where I am meant to tell you about how great my coding
                  skills are and my motivation. But if you want to see that you
                  are welcome to head over to my Linkedin. It is linked at the
                  bottom of the page.

                  This about me is more about the journey I have been through to
                  get here. I grew up in the beautiful high country of the South
                  Island. Danseys Pass specifically. Sheep and beef were our
                  bread and butter, and still are for most of my family. After
                  school I went shepherding and absolutely loved it.
                </p>

                <p>
                  I studied agri-business at Massey University with the
                  intention of entering the agri-business sector. I did this by
                  working for New Zealand Merino a wool exporting company. Here
                  I realised a huge passion for helping people, and I was
                  hooked.
                </p>

                <p>
                  I moved into the public sector to pursue this passion. Working
                  firstly for DoC as their local high country, crown pastoral
                  land ranger. Before heading into teaching first with the
                  Central Otago Polytech and then the National Trade Academy.
                  During this period I was getting frustrated with the industry
                  changing so slowly to the challenges it was facing and thought
                  there must be something more helpful I could be doing.
                </p>

                <p>
                  This is how I ended up in tech. I wanted to pursue something
                  more challenging, which was also moving to address future
                  problems. Tech has the potential to challenge so many of the
                  frustrations and problems we face and this is where I want to
                  be.
